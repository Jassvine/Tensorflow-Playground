# Tensorflow-Playground
In a neural network, an activation function specifies how
the weighted sum of the input is turned into an output from a
node or nodes in a layer. The activation function is
sometimes known as a "transfer function." When an
activation function's output range is restricted, it's referred to
as a "squashing function." Many activation functions are
nonlinear, which is known as "nonlinearity" in the layer or
network architecture.
The activation function chosen has a significant impact
on the neural network's capabilities and performance, and
different activation functions may be utilised in different
portions of the model. Although networks are designed to
use the same activation function for all nodes in a layer, the
activation function is applied within or after the internal
processing of each node in the network

For this project, Tensorflow Playground was used. Values of the activation fucntion were tweaked
to understand the changes and characteristics of it that will influence the neural network model.
